import random
#
# # a)
#
# for i in range(4):
#     L1 = ['a', 'b']
#     L2 = ['x', 'y']
#     result = [a + b for a in L1 for b in L2]
#
# for i in range(1):
#     random.shuffle(result)
#     print(result)

#b)

# L = []
# for i in range(100):
#     L.append(i * i * 3 + 1) #**2
# print(L)
# # I was not sure how to square the list properly

# c)

# import newmod
# must have a file open that is in the same directory as the newmod module

# from newmod import newfunc(5)


# Question 2

# for int in range(101):
#     print(random.randint(1,100))
#     # if int == 1 or 100:
#     #     print("finished.")
#     #     break
# # i tried using if statements to stop the loops if it randomly chose 100 or 1 but I was having problems


# Question 3

# question_3 = "R"
# print(''.join(random.choice(question_3) for i in range(4,13)) )
# I was not sure how to get R print randomly between 4 and 12
